It was decided to implement both parts in a single project where on Class in the project will create the Queue and another class will use it to perform the calculation.
In this way repeating implementation of common code between the two projects can be avoided
This will help in synchronisation of the code and avoidance of errors and inconsistencies.
There are also a few unit tests implemented to test the functionality of a few important methods.
